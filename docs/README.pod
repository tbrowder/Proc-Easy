=head1 NAME

B<Proc::Easy> - Provides routine C<run-command> to ease using Raku's B<Proc> class.

NOTE: This module replaces the C<run-command> portion of the
deprecated module C<Proc::More>. Note also the API has changed
slightly: the previous C<:$all> option was removed and its behavior
is now the default (i.e., all three of the output parameter values are
returned as a list of three elements unless only one is selected as an
option).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>
    use Proc::Easy;
    my $cmd = "some-user-prog arg1 arg2";
    my $other-dir = $*TMPDIR";
    my ($exitcode, $stderr, $stdout) = run-command $cmd, :dir($other-dir);
=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Proc::Easy> is designed to make using the C<run> routine from class
C<Proc> easier for the usual, simple case when the myriad ways to use
C<Proc>'s C<run> are not required.

=head2 sub run-command

=begin code :lang<raku>

sub run-command(Str:D $cmd,
		:$exit,
                :$err,
		:$out,
		:$dir, # run command in dir 'dir'
		:$debug,
	       ) is export {...}
=end code

=head3 Parameters:

=item C<$cmd>    - A string that contains a command suitable for using Raku's C<run> routine
=item C<:$exit>  - Returns the exit code  which should be zero (false) for a successful command execution
=item C<:$err>   - Returns C<stderr>
=item C<:$out>   - Returns C<stdout>
=item C<:$dir>   - Runs the command in directory 'dir'
=item C<:$debug> - Prints extra info to stdout AFTER the C<proc> command

=head3 Returns:

A three-element list of the exit code and results from C<stderr>
and C<stdout>, respectively. Either of the three may be selected individually if
desired. (If more than one is selected, only one is returned in the
order of exit code, C<stderr>, or C<stdout>.) There is also the capability
to send debug messages to C<stdout> by including the C<:$debug> option.
